"""What every configured provider is serving, gathered into one list.

Asked live rather than kept as a list of Primer's own, so a model pulled on
a workstation shows up without redeploying Primer to match.

Providers are asked in parallel and each is allowed to fail on its own. A
deployment with a hosted API and a machine at home that is currently asleep
can still answer: the models it can reach are offered, and the ones it
cannot are named so an operator knows which half is missing. That is the
distinction the whole module exists to preserve - "nothing is available" and
"one of three is unavailable" need different reactions, and collapsing them
is how an interface ends up lying about a deployment's health.
