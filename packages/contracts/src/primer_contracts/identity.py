    One rule, shared, because two services enforce it and a deployment where
    they disagreed about who is an administrator would be a deployment whose
    answer depends on which door you knocked on.

    Group membership is the whole test. Primer implements no authentication
    and no roles of its own; the operator names a group in their identity
    provider, the proxy asserts it, and this is where that assertion is read.
    It stays consistent with `groups` never granting access to a *resource* -
    no library becomes readable because of this, only the deployment's own
    configuration.

    Fails closed. Authentication on with no group named means nobody is an
    administrator, which is the safe reading of an operator who has not made
    the decision yet: the alternative is that every user of a shared
    deployment can repoint it at an endpoint of their own.

    With authentication off there is exactly one identity and it is whoever
    is running Primer - a single-user Compose stack, by construction. There
    is nobody to withhold this from, and withholding it would leave that
    deployment with no way to reach its own settings at all.
