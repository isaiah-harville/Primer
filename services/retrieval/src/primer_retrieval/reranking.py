"""Reordering what the vector search found, by reading it properly.

A vector search compares a question to a passage through two embeddings that
were made without knowing about each other. It is fast and it is
approximate, and the approximation shows in the ordering: the passage that
actually answers the question is often in the first twenty results but not
in the first six.

A reranker reads the pair together and scores it. That is far more expensive
per passage, which is the whole design: search widely and cheaply, then read
a shortlist carefully. Fetching twenty and keeping six costs one reranker
pass over twenty short texts and buys an ordering that a vector search
cannot produce at any `top_k`.

Off unless configured. Primer ships no model, and a deployment without a
reranker endpoint must behave exactly as it did before this existed - the
vector ordering, truncated to what was asked for.

The protocol is a `/rerank` endpoint, which text-embeddings-inference,
vLLM, Cohere and Jina all serve - though not identically, and the
differences are load-bearing. TEI reads the passages from `texts` and
returns `score`; the others read `documents` and return `relevance_score`.
Primer sends both names and reads either, because holding no model of its
own means it does not get to pick whose server this is.
