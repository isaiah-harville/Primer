"""Remembering the turns that no longer fit.

Dropping the oldest turns keeps a conversation inside the window, but it
also means a thread quietly loses its own beginning: the document someone
named twenty messages ago, the constraint they gave once, the thing they
already said they had tried. What is dropped is not noise, it is just old.

So the turns that fall out are summarized instead, and the summary is
carried in their place. It is incremental - each pass folds the newly
dropped turns into what was already remembered - because re-reading the
whole conversation every time would grow with the conversation, which is the
opposite of what compacting is for.

Two things are deliberate. The summary is written by the same endpoint that
answers, which means compaction costs a model call, so it happens only when
something is actually about to be dropped. And a failure here is never a
failed turn: the fallback is the behaviour that existed before, which is to
drop the turns and answer anyway. A conversation losing its memory is worse
than the alternative only if the alternative is answering; it is much better
than an error.
