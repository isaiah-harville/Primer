"""Handing a job to the workers.

Publishing is deliberately not part of the upload transaction. A message
sent before the commit can outlive a rollback, and a worker would then claim
a job that does not exist. Routes publish through a background task, which
runs after the response - and therefore after the session dependency has
committed - so a message only ever names a job that is really there.

The reverse failure is possible and is the acceptable one: a crash between
commit and publish leaves a job queued in the database with no message. That
is visible, recoverable by re-enqueueing, and harms nothing in the meantime.
