"""The stage machine every ingestion job walks.

Control is the only writer of job state, so this table is the single
definition of what may follow what. Workers ask to enter a stage and are
told whether they may; they never compute the next state themselves.

Each stage names three states. `entry` is what the job must be in to be
claimable, `active` is what a holder sets while working, and `done` is what
completion advances to - which is the next stage's `entry`. Duplicate
delivery is caught by that chain: a redelivered message finds the job past
its stage's entry state and is told the stage is already completed.
