"""Reading the text inside pictures that a format's own pipeline never opens.

Docling runs OCR as part of its PDF pipeline. Every other format Primer
accepts is converted by `SimplePipeline`, which has no OCR options at all -
so a slide whose content is a pasted chart, or a report whose figures carry
its numbers, converts to a title and an empty `<!-- image -->`.

That is most of what a slide deck is. A deck of screenshots was accepted,
reported ready, and indexed as almost nothing, which reads to whoever
uploaded it as Primer being unable to find text that is plainly on the
page.

The recognized text is a transcription rather than the document's own
characters, so a citation drawn from it can be subtly wrong in a way a
reader cannot see. That is the same trade the PDF pipeline already makes
and it is worth making, but it is a trade.
