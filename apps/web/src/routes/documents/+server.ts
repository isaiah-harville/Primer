/**
 * Uploading a document, from wherever the user happens to be.
 *
 * The browser cannot reach Control directly, so this is how a file gets
 * there: the identity headers Primer trusts are set by the edge proxy, and a
 * browser that could call Control itself could set them itself.
 *
 * A library may be named or not. Chat lets you drop a file into a
 * conversation that has no library attached, and the file has to live
 * somewhere, so one is created to hold it. Creating it here rather than in
 * the browser means the create and the upload are one request: a page closed
 * midway leaves either nothing or a library with its document in it, never a
 * library the user never asked for and cannot explain.
