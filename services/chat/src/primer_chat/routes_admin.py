"""Managing the endpoints this deployment answers from.

Restricted to administrators, because these routes decide where every user's
questions are sent and what credential goes with them. The rule itself lives
in the contracts package, shared with Control, so the two services cannot
disagree about who counts as one.

No route returns an API key. A stored key can be replaced or removed, and a
caller can learn whether one is held; it cannot be read back. A key a page
can display is a key a screenshot, a cache, or a browser extension can carry
away, and it is usually somebody's paid account with a third party.

The provider configured in the chart is listed here but cannot be edited: it
lives in the environment and changes by redeploying. Letting it be edited
would put a deployment's own configuration in two places that could then
disagree about which one is in force.
