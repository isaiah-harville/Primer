  Exactly the height of the window, and no taller. The page itself never
  scrolls; the content region does. Anything that added height out here - a
  banner across the top, say - gave every screen a scrollbar whether or not
  it had anything to scroll.

  `h-viewport` rather than `h-screen`, because on a phone they are different
  heights. `100vh` is the viewport with the browser's chrome retracted, so a
  shell sized to it is taller than the screen and the whole interface slides
  around under a fixed header while the composer sits below the fold.

		  A flex column, so a page that wants the full height can ask for it

		  100vh and going wrong whenever the padding changes.
		-->
		<!--
		  Ordinary block flow, and the only thing in the frame that scrolls.
		  Not a flex column: most pages are a document that should simply run
		  on and scroll, and making every one of them a flex item means each
		  has to think about shrinking. A page that wants the full height
		  instead asks with `h-full`, which works because this has one.

		<!--
		  `overscroll-contain` so reaching the end of a long page stops there
		  rather than handing the gesture on. With the document locked there
		  is nothing behind this to scroll, and on iOS the offer alone is
		  enough to rubber-band the whole interface.
		-->
		<!--
		  Padding steps down on a phone rather than up on a desktop. 24px of
		  gutter either side of a 360px screen is a seventh of the width
		  spent on nothing, and what it costs is the filename column. The
		  `sm` and `lg` steps are the values this always had, so nothing
		  above a phone moves.
