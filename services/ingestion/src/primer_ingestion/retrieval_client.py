"""The worker's view of the Retrieval service.

Workers never touch a vector store. They hand chunks to Retrieval, which is
the only process that knows what backend is deployed or how it filters.

Everything that can go wrong on the wire is turned into a `StageError`
here, at the one place that makes the call. A stage that let an HTTP error
escape reported it through the catch-all in `tasks`, which is deliberately
sanitized - so an embedding endpoint that was refusing connections reached
the user as "The stage failed unexpectedly", the same words as a genuine
bug in Primer, and told whoever read it nothing about where to look.
