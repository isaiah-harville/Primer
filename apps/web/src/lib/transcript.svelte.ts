/**
 * The turns on screen, and the one still being written.
 *
 * The reactive half of `transcript.ts`, which holds the pure part: what a
 * turn is, and how a stored conversation is read back into turns. Split
 * that way because runes only exist in `.svelte.ts`, and everything that
 * does not need them is worth more as something a test can call directly.
 *
 * This exists as a module rather than as state in the page because of how
 * Svelte 5 reacts to change. A `$state` array hands out a proxy, and the
 * proxy creates a signal for a property the first time that property is
 * read - so a write to the *underlying* object afterwards never reaches the
 * screen. Folding a stream of events into a turn is exactly that shape of
 * code: hold the turn, mutate it as fragments arrive. Done that way the
 * answer streamed in, was stored, and never appeared; reloading the page
 * showed it, because the reload read it back from Chat.
 *
 * So an answer is written back through the array on every event, and the
 * running state is kept in a local that never went into `$state` at all.
