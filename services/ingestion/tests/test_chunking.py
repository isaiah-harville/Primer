"""How a document is split, which is what a citation ends up quoting.

`HybridChunker` needs the embedding model's tokenizer. Without one, chunking
falls back to `HierarchicalChunker`, which splits on document structure and
merges nothing, so a document whose layout is many short items is stored one
line at a time. Both are real chunkers and both produce chunks, so the
fallback looks like a working install right up until someone reads a
citation and finds two words in it. These pin the two things that make the
difference visible - a warning when it happens, and a refusal when a
tokenizer was configured but is wrong.
