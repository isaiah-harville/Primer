# Primer

Primer is a self-hosted research assistant. You upload your own sources into
private libraries, and it answers questions from them with citations back to
the passages it used.

It is built for people who cannot or will not send their documents to a
hosted service: everything runs on your infrastructure, against your own
model endpoints.

## What it does

- **Private libraries.** A library belongs to one person. Nobody else can
  read it, list it, or discover that it exists.
- **Real documents.** PDF, Word, PowerPoint, Markdown, and plain text,
  including text that exists only inside images.
- **Answers with citations.** Every claim points at a passage in a specific
  version of a specific document, so you can check it.
- **Your models.** Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, hosted or local.

## How it fits together

</div>

Four processes, each owning one thing. The **Control API** owns what exists
and who may see it. **Ingestion workers** turn uploaded files into passages.
**Retrieval** is the only process that touches a vector store. The **web
app** is what you use.

## Where to start

- New to Primer? [Getting started](guide/getting-started.md).
- Running it for a team? [Configuration](operations/configuration.md) and
  [Deploying](operations/deploying.md).
- Want to know how it works? [Architecture](architecture/index.md).

!!! note "This documentation describes what is built"
    Primer is under active development. Pages document behaviour that exists
    and is tested, and say so plainly where something is not built yet.
