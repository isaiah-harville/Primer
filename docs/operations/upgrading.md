# Upgrading

Most upgrades are a new image tag and [the migrations](migrations.md). The
exceptions are listed here, newest first: changes where something already
running has to be dealt with before the new version will start.

## Ingestion queues became quorum queues

**Affects:** any deployment whose broker already has the `ingestion.*`
queues, which is every deployment that has run a worker.

RabbitMQ will not redeclare an existing queue with a different type. A worker
started against the old queues fails with `PRECONDITION_FAILED` and cannot
consume anything, so the queues have to be removed first.

The change is worth the interruption twice over. Quorum queues replicate, so
queued ingestion work survives a broker restart properly rather than by
luck. They also settle a deprecation: RabbitMQ 4.1 deprecated channel-wide
prefetch, and Celery only stops asking for it once it sees a queue declared
this way — until then every worker start writes errors into the broker log.

### Compose

Nothing durable lives in these queues between runs on a single-machine
profile, so removing the broker's data is the simplest route:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose/compose.yaml down
docker volume rm primer_rabbitmq-data
docker compose -f deploy/compose/compose.yaml up --wait
```

### Kubernetes, or any broker with work in flight

Let the queues drain first, then delete them. A document whose job is deleted
mid-flight is not lost — Control still holds it in a non-terminal state — but
it will need reindexing, so draining is the kinder order.

```bash
# Stop consuming and publishing.
kubectl scale deployment -l app.kubernetes.io/component=worker --replicas=0

# Confirm nothing is waiting, then remove them.
rabbitmqctl list_queues name messages | grep ingestion
for queue in ingestion.parse ingestion.embed ingestion.index ingestion.delete ingestion.dead; do
  rabbitmqctl delete_queue "$queue"
done

kubectl scale deployment -l app.kubernetes.io/component=worker --replicas=1
```

The workers redeclare them on the next start. Any document left mid-flight
shows as failed and can be reindexed from its library.
