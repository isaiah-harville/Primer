# Configuration

Every setting is an environment variable prefixed `PRIMER_`. Unknown
settings are rejected at startup rather than ignored, so a typo fails loudly
instead of silently keeping a default.

## Control API

| Variable | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PRIMER_AUTH_MODE` | `disabled` | `disabled` or `oidc` |
| `PRIMER_DATABASE_URL` | local PostgreSQL | Migrations are applied out of band |
| `PRIMER_SOURCE_STORE_URL` | `file:///var/lib/primer/sources` | `file://` or `s3://`; see below |
| `PRIMER_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` | `104857600` | Enforced while reading |
| `PRIMER_BROKER_URL` | unset | Unset leaves uploads queued |
| `PRIMER_INTERNAL_API_TOKEN` | unset | **Unset denies the internal API** |
| `PRIMER_SUBJECT_HEADER` | `X-Forwarded-User` | Set by the proxy |
| `PRIMER_JOB_LEASE_SECONDS` | `300` | Before another worker may re-claim |
| `PRIMER_MAX_JOB_ATTEMPTS` | `5` | Hard bound, independent of workers |

## Ingestion workers

| Variable | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PRIMER_BROKER_URL` | local RabbitMQ | Must match Control's |
| `PRIMER_CONTROL_URL` | `http://control-api:8000` | Cluster-internal |
| `PRIMER_RETRIEVAL_URL` | `http://retrieval:8000` | Cluster-internal |
| `PRIMER_SERVICE_TOKEN` | unset | Must match the services' tokens |
| `PRIMER_SOURCE_STORE_URL` | `file:///var/lib/primer/sources` | Same store as Control |
| `PRIMER_ENABLE_OCR` | `true` | Read text from images |
| `PRIMER_CHUNK_TOKENIZER` | unset | Tokenizer of the embedding model |
| `PRIMER_MAX_CHUNK_TOKENS` | `512` | Ignored without a tokenizer |
| `PRIMER_MAX_CHUNKS_PER_DOCUMENT` | `5000` | Refuse rather than half-index |
| `PRIMER_PARSE_DEADLINE_SECONDS` | `900` | Checked between phases |
| `PRIMER_MAX_RETRIES` | `4` | Control holds its own bound |

## Retrieval

| Variable | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PRIMER_VECTOR_STORE` | `pgvector` | `pgvector` or `qdrant` |
| `PRIMER_DATABASE_URL` | local PostgreSQL | For pgvector |
| `PRIMER_VECTOR_SCHEMA` | `vectors` | Kept apart from Control's schema |
| `PRIMER_QDRANT_URL` | unset | **Required** when using Qdrant |
| `PRIMER_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | `text-embedding-3-small` | |
| `PRIMER_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS` | `1536` | Must match the model |
| `PRIMER_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL` | unset | Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| `PRIMER_EMBEDDING_API_KEY` | unset | |
| `PRIMER_INTERNAL_API_TOKEN` | unset | **Unset denies the internal API** |


## Source storage

Uploaded files go wherever `PRIMER_SOURCE_STORE_URL` points, through
`fsspec`. Two schemes are usable, because those are the backends Primer
installs:

| Scheme | For |
| --- | --- |
| `file://` | One machine. A `ReadWriteOnce` volume cannot be shared between nodes, so this does not survive a second replica. |
| `s3://` | Anything with more than one replica: S3, MinIO, Ceph, R2. |

`fsspec` imports a backend on first use rather than at startup, so a scheme
whose package is not installed fails on somebody's first upload rather than
when the service starts. Adding another one means adding its package to
`primer-storage` and rebuilding the images; naming it in a URL is not
enough.

Credentials are the backend's own environment rather than Primer settings —
`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `FSSPEC_S3_ENDPOINT_URL`
for anything that is not AWS. In Kubernetes they come from
`sourceStore.existingSecret`, mounted whole into Control and the ingestion
workers and nothing else: those are the only processes that open a source
object.


## Chat

| Variable | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PRIMER_CHAT_BASE_URL` | unset | Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| `PRIMER_CHAT_MODEL` | `gpt-4o-mini` | The default a question gets |
| `PRIMER_CHAT_MODELS` | unset | Further models a user may choose |
| `PRIMER_CHAT_API_KEY` | unset | Many local servers ignore it |
| `PRIMER_CHAT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `120` | Per request to the model |
| `PRIMER_CONTROL_URL` | `http://control-api:8000` | Cluster-internal |
| `PRIMER_RETRIEVAL_URL` | `http://retrieval:8000` | Cluster-internal |
| `PRIMER_RETRIEVAL_LIMIT` | `8` | Passages per question; bounds prompt size |
| `PRIMER_CHAT_HISTORY_MESSAGES` | `20` | Earlier turns a follow-up may recall |
| `PRIMER_CHAT_CONTEXT_TOKENS` | `8192` | Window assumed for a model not named below |
| `PRIMER_CHAT_MODEL_CONTEXT_TOKENS` | unset | Per-model windows, as JSON |
| `PRIMER_CHAT_REPLY_TOKENS` | `1024` | Held back out of the window for the answer |
| `PRIMER_CHAT_CHARACTERS_PER_TOKEN` | `4.0` | How the prompt's size is estimated |
| `PRIMER_CHAT_COMPACT_HISTORY` | `true` | Summarize turns instead of dropping them |
| `PRIMER_CHAT_SUMMARY_TOKENS` | `512` | Room reserved for that summary |
| `PRIMER_SERVICE_TOKEN` | unset | Must match the services' tokens |

### Offering more than one model

`PRIMER_CHAT_MODELS` is a JSON list of further model names on the same
endpoint, and it is what a user picks between:

```bash
PRIMER_CHAT_MODEL=llama3.1:70b
PRIMER_CHAT_MODELS='["qwen2.5-coder:32b", "mistral-small"]'
```

The list is yours rather than the endpoint's. An OpenAI-compatible server
usually serves models nobody meant to offer here, and one of them being
expensive or unreviewed is not something to find out from a dropdown, so
Primer offers only what you name. A request for anything else is refused
rather than quietly answered by the default: a user who chose a model and
received an answer from another one has been misled about where it came
from, and Primer records the model against the message.

They share one endpoint, one API key, and one `PRIMER_RETRIEVAL_LIMIT`.
They need not share a context window: see below.


### Fitting the prompt into the context window

A conversation that remembers itself grows, and retrieved passages are
added on top of it. Primer estimates how large a prompt has become and
cuts it down to fit rather than letting the endpoint refuse the turn.

`PRIMER_CHAT_CONTEXT_TOKENS` is the window Primer assumes. Name the models
that differ in `PRIMER_CHAT_MODEL_CONTEXT_TOKENS`, a JSON object keyed by
model name:

```bash
PRIMER_CHAT_CONTEXT_TOKENS=8192
PRIMER_CHAT_MODEL_CONTEXT_TOKENS='{"llama3.1:70b": 131072, "mistral-small": 32768}'
```

`PRIMER_CHAT_REPLY_TOKENS` is held back out of that window so the answer
has somewhere to go. What is left is spent on retrieved passages first and
the conversation's history second, so a long thread loses its oldest turns
before it loses the evidence the current question is grounded in. If not
even one passage fits, the turn fails rather than answering ungrounded.

Primer measures nothing: it estimates `PRIMER_CHAT_CHARACTERS_PER_TOKEN`
characters to the token and charges a small overhead per message. There is
no tokenizer that is right for every OpenAI-compatible endpoint, and the
usual ones fetch vocabularies over the network, which a self-hosted Primer
may not have. The default of 4.0 is deliberately conservative for English
prose; lower it if your users write in a language or a notation that
tokenizes less kindly, and only raise it if you have measured your own
model and want the room back.


### Compacting a long conversation

Dropping the oldest turns keeps a thread inside the window, and what it
costs is the beginning of the thread — the document someone named ten
messages ago, the constraint they gave once and never repeated. With
`PRIMER_CHAT_COMPACT_HISTORY` on, which is the default, the turns that fall
out are summarized on their way out and the summary is carried in their
place.

It is incremental: each pass folds the newly dropped turns into what was
already remembered, so compacting an hour-long conversation does not cost
more each time. The summary is written by the same endpoint that answers, so
it costs a model call — but only on a turn that would otherwise have dropped
something, and never on a conversation that still fits.

`PRIMER_CHAT_SUMMARY_TOKENS` is the room set aside for it, and the length
the summarizer is held to; anything longer is cut. The room is reserved
whether or not a summary exists yet, so writing the first one never costs
the history a turn it was already shown. It is also capped at a quarter of
the window however large you set it: the passages a question is answered
from are the point, and a small model must not spend half its context
remembering a conversation it can no longer ground.

If the summarizer fails, the turn is still answered. The conversation simply
forgets, which is what would have happened anyway.

Turning it off is reasonable for a metered endpoint, or where the extra
latency before the first token matters more than a long thread's memory.
The summary of a conversation already compacted is still carried; forgetting
it would lose the turns it stands for.

Summaries are Primer's own note to itself. They are not shown in the
transcript and no endpoint returns them — the messages they stand for are
all still there, and are what a reader is shown.


## Settings that fail at startup

Some combinations are refused rather than accepted and worked around later:

- `PRIMER_AUTH_MODE=oidc` with an empty subject header. The alternative is a
  deployment that believes it is authenticated but authenticates nobody.
- `PRIMER_VECTOR_STORE=qdrant` with no `PRIMER_QDRANT_URL`. Discovering that
  on the first search means it surfaces as a broken product rather than a
  broken deployment.

## Changing the embedding model

Changing the model or its dimensions invalidates every existing vector.
Vectors from different models are not comparable, and a store will reject
the wrong width outright.

Reindex your documents after such a change. Primer does not yet do this for
you, and will not detect it on your behalf.
