"""How a deployment is wired, as an administrator needs to see it.

Reported rather than inferred. An operator debugging a self-hosted install
otherwise has to read a values file and several sets of container logs to
learn what Primer was pointed at and which of it is answering.

No credential appears in any of these, not even masked: a URL carrying one
is reported with that part removed, because a masked secret still says how
long it was and a screenshot of a settings page is a thing people paste into
issues.
