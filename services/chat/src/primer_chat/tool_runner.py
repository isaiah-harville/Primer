"""Running an approved tool call.

Primer never executes anything itself. Tools live behind MCP servers the
operator configured, invoked through Haystack, so the process that runs a
command is one the operator chose and isolated - not this one.

Approval is re-checked immediately before invocation rather than trusted
from when it was granted. An approval that expired while a queue drained is
not an approval, and the gap between deciding and running is exactly where
that matters.
