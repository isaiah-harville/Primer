# Adding documents

## What happens to an upload

An upload is checked, stored, and queued before the response comes back.
From there, work happens in the background:

<div class="primer-diagram" markdown>
![Ingestion pipeline states](../assets/diagrams/ingestion-pipeline.svg#only-light)
![Ingestion pipeline states](../assets/diagrams/ingestion-pipeline-dark.svg#only-dark)
</div>

A document reports one of these states while you wait:

| State | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| `queued` | Stored and waiting for a worker |
| `parsing` | Being read and split into passages |
| `chunking` | Read; waiting to be embedded |
| `embedding` | Passages being turned into vectors |
| `indexing` | Written to the index; being checked |
| `ready` | Searchable |
| `failed` | Something went wrong; see the detail |
| `unsupported` | Nothing readable could be found |

## Duplicate files

If you upload the same bytes twice, Primer stores them once. Both documents
exist independently — different names, different libraries if you like — but
the file behind them is shared.

This is invisible from the outside, deliberately. Primer never tells you
that a file you uploaded already existed, because that would reveal
something about content you cannot otherwise see.

## Replacing a document

Uploading a replacement adds a new **version** rather than overwriting the
old one. Older versions stay readable, so a citation made last month still
resolves to the text that was actually quoted, not to whatever the document
says now.

While a replacement is being indexed, the previous version keeps answering
questions. The switch happens in one step when the new index is complete and
verified — never halfway.

## Rebuilding an index

Reindexing rebuilds a document's passages without re-uploading it. Use it
after changing the embedding model, or if a document was indexed while
something was misconfigured.

The current index keeps answering throughout. The new build only becomes the
answer once it is complete and verified, and a build that fails changes
nothing.

Pressing reindex twice does not start two builds. A rebuild already in
flight is reported as it stands.

## Deleting a document

A deleted document stops being searchable at once. Its passages, metadata,
and stored file are removed afterwards, in that order.

The order is deliberate. Passages go first because they are what a search
can still reach. The file goes last, and only if no other document uses it:
if you and a colleague uploaded the same PDF, deleting yours leaves theirs
intact and the file in place.

Deleting a document that is already deleted reports that it is not found,
the same as any document you cannot see. It does not schedule a second round
of cleanup.

## Limits

- Uploads are capped by a size limit the operator sets (100 MB by default).
- Very large documents are refused rather than partially indexed, because a
  document indexed halfway would answer questions from part of its content
  with nothing to indicate the rest was dropped.
