"""What the model list says across several providers at once.

Two failures are guarded here, and they are opposites.

The first is silence about a broken provider. Primer used to answer an
unreachable endpoint with the name of its configured default, so the picker
showed a model, the deployment looked healthy, and the first sign of trouble
was a question that hung and then failed.

The second is over-reacting to one. A deployment holding a hosted API and a
workstation that happens to be asleep can still answer perfectly well, and an
interface that reported it as broken would be wrong in the other direction.
"Nothing is available" and "one of three is unavailable" need different
reactions, and the whole point of the catalog is keeping them apart.

Real sockets rather than patched clients: "unreachable" and "answered badly"
are different states, and only a real connection tells them apart.
