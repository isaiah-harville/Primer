Which tokenizer chunking is bounded by, and how large a chunk may get.

Derived from the embedding model rather than defaulted to a name of its own,
because the correct value is not a preference: chunks are sized to fit the
model that embeds them, so the tokenizer that decides where a chunk ends has
to be that model's. A separate default here would be a second place to keep
in step with `inference.embeddings.model`, and the two silently disagreeing
produces chunks that are too long for the embedder to read whole.

The `/` test is what tells a self-hosted model from a hosted one. Anything
served from Hugging Face is named `owner/model` and publishes a tokenizer;
`text-embedding-3-small` and `embed-english-v3.0` name no repository and
have none to fetch, so nothing is emitted and the worker says at startup
that it is chunking on structure alone. Set `ingestion.chunkTokenizer` to
name a tokenizer for one of those - the nearest open model with the same
vocabulary is usually right, and being approximately right about where a
chunk ends is far better than not bounding it at all.

Only the parse worker gets these. It is the only process that chunks, and a
tokenizer is a download.

How the parse worker's model cache may be attached.

Derived from the replica count rather than defaulted to a mode of its own,
because it is not a preference: every parse replica mounts this one claim,
so what the volume must support is decided entirely by how many replicas
there are. A standalone default would be a second thing to keep in step
with `workers.parse.replicas`, and the two disagreeing is precisely the
failure this derivation removes - a scaled deployment whose extra pods can
never attach anything and sit Pending with no explanation.

One replica gets ReadWriteOnce. Not merely because every storage class has
it, though that matters for a chart that has to install on EBS, GCE PD,
Azure Disk and the local-path provisioner that k3s and kind default to -
but because ReadWriteMany is worse at that count. Longhorn and its like
serve RWX through an NFS share-manager pod, which is a second workload and
a network hop for a volume exactly one pod ever opens.

More than one gets ReadWriteMany, which is the only mode that lets them
coexist. That needs a storage class providing it; a cluster without one
sees the claim stay Pending, which is a plain answer to having asked for a
topology the storage cannot serve. It is on the scaling path rather than
the install path, which is where a question like that belongs.

Set `modelCache.accessMode` explicitly to override either.
