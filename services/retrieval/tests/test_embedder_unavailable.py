"""A dependency Retrieval needs, reported as itself rather than as a 500.

The embedder is a separate process that has to be running and reachable, so
this is the single most likely thing to be wrong on a self-hosted install.
It used to surface as an unhandled exception and a bare 500 with a stack
trace, which Chat then reported to the reader as an answer that stopped -
sending whoever read it to look at the model, which was fine.

Both directions matter. Searching a library and indexing a document go
through the same endpoint and fail the same way, and for a while only
searching said so: an embedder that was down during ingestion surfaced to
the user as a document whose stage "failed unexpectedly", which is the
message every unrelated bug also produces.

The store is the other half. Indexing embeds and then writes, and the write
was unguarded long after the embedding was: a store that refused reached the
user as "Retrieval answered 500", which says only that Retrieval was reached.
