"""Inference providers a deployment can answer from.

Primer ships no model and is not tied to one endpoint. An operator may run a
vLLM on their own hardware, keep an Ollama on a workstation, and hold an
account with a hosted API, and there is no reason a user should have to pick
between those at deploy time: they are different models with different costs
and different strengths, and which one suits a question is a decision that
belongs at the moment the question is asked.

So providers are a list, not a setting. Everything here follows from that.

The one configured in the chart or the environment is in that list too,
reported as `deployment` rather than kept somewhere separate. A deployment
that has never opened the settings page still has exactly one provider and
behaves as it always did, and the interface has one kind of thing to show
rather than a special case beside a general one.

No API key ever appears here. `api_key_set` is the only thing said about it,
because a key that a page can display is a key that a screenshot, a cache, or
a browser extension can carry away.
