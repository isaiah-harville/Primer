 *
 * Having no model to answer with is different, and is not smoothed over.
 * `modelsProblem` carries the reason - Chat itself unreachable, or Chat
 * reachable and the inference endpoint behind it not - so the screen can say
 * which. Offering a model that nothing is serving would be worse than
 * offering none: it reads as a working deployment right up until someone
 * asks a question.
 *
 * What is not swallowed is why a named conversation did not open. A thread
 * that silently appears blank looks like a thread that lost its messages, so
 * the reason is returned and said on the page.
