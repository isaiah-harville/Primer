"""Document conversion, and the limits it runs under.

Conversion is Docling's `DocumentConverter`. Primer adds no parser of its
own: extracting structure from PDF and DOCX is exactly the problem Docling
exists to solve, and a regex fallback here would produce citations that
point at nothing.

What Primer does add is containment. A converted document is untrusted
input, so conversion runs against a private copy in a temporary directory
that is removed on every path out, and its cost is bounded before its
results are used.
