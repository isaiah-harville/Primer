"""Coming back to a conversation, and getting rid of one.

A conversation that can be resumed is also one that accumulates, so the two
belong together: what is listed can be reopened, and what is reopened can be
thrown away. Both are asked in one caller's name - the list is the caller's
own, and a stranger's conversation is not found rather than forbidden.
