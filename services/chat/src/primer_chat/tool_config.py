"""Operator-supplied tool configuration.

Everything here comes from deployment configuration and nothing from a user
or a model. A model cannot ask for a server to be added, a tool to be
allowed, or a sandbox requirement to be waived.

Shell and code execution carry an extra requirement: the operator must
declare, explicitly, that the MCP server providing them runs each session in
an ephemeral sandbox with no host mounts, no secrets, and no network by
default. Primer cannot verify that claim from the outside - what it can do
is refuse to offer such tools when nobody has made it.
