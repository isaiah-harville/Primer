"""Write each service's OpenAPI schema to `schemas/`.

The schemas are checked in so that the web app's types can be generated
from them without a Python toolchain, and so that a contract change shows
up as a diff in a pull request rather than as a surprise at runtime. CI
regenerates them and fails on any difference.

The apps are built with authentication disabled and no database, because
nothing here is served: FastAPI assembles the schema from the routes and
the models, and neither depends on a connection.
