"""Job transitions for ingestion workers.

Cluster-internal: the edge proxy must not route `/internal` from outside.
Authorization here is a service credential, and no route takes a principal,
because a worker acts on a job rather than on behalf of a person. Every
route is safe to call twice - that is the point of the protocol, not a
side effect of it.
