"""Chat against a real PostgreSQL, with Control, Retrieval, and the model faked.

The three are faked deliberately. What needs testing here is the ordering -
authorize, then retrieve, then generate - and the persistence of what came
out. None of that depends on those being real, and all of it is easier to
assert when the fakes can record exactly what they were asked.
