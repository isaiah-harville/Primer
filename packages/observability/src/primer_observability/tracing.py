"""OpenTelemetry tracing, with the same content rule as logs.

Spans are attributed with ids and outcomes, never with text. A span
attribute is exactly as readable as a log line to whoever runs the collector,
and usually more widely retained.

W3C trace context propagates over HTTP and Celery, so one question's journey
through Chat, Retrieval, and the workers reads as a single trace without any
of them carrying what the question was.
