"""Authorization answers for other Primer services.

Cluster-internal, and separate from the ingestion routes because these do
take a principal: a worker acts on a job, but Chat acts on behalf of a
person and has to be told what that person may read.

Control answers these questions rather than exporting its rules, so there is
exactly one implementation of who may see what. A service that decided
locally would be a second copy to drift.
