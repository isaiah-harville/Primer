"""The Retrieval service.

Every route takes a principal, a library, and a generation. Those are not
optional and have no defaults: a request that could omit its scope would, on
the day a caller forgot, return another user's documents. Pydantic rejects
such a request with 422 before any store is reached.

The principal is audit context, not authorization. Whether this caller may
read this library was decided by Control before the request was made;
repeating that decision here without Control's data would mean guessing.
