"""Remembering a conversation that no longer fits in one.

Dropping the oldest turns is what keeps a long thread inside the window, and
what it costs is the beginning of the thread: the document someone named ten
messages ago, the constraint they gave once. These prove the turns that fall
out are summarized on their way out, that the summary is carried in their
place, and that it never costs the answer - a summarizer that fails is a
conversation with a shorter memory, not a question that goes unanswered.
