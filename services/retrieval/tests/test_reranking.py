"""Reordering a shortlist, and what happens when that cannot be done.

The reranker is an improvement to an ordering that is already correct. So
the properties worth pinning are mostly about it getting out of the way: a
deployment without one behaves exactly as it did before, and one whose
reranker is down returns the vector ordering rather than an error.

A search that failed because the optional stage failed would be a
regression dressed as a feature.
