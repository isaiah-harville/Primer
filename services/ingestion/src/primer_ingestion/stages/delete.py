"""The delete stage: removing what a tombstoned document left behind.

Order is the whole design. Passages go first, because they are what a search
can still reach. Metadata goes next, and only then the stored bytes - a
source object is shared between every document holding identical content, so
it may only be removed once the database says nothing references it.

Every step is safe to repeat. This message can be redelivered, and a
half-finished cleanup must be finishable rather than a state someone has to
repair by hand.
