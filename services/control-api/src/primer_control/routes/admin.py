"""What this deployment is wired to, and whether any of it is answering.

An operator debugging a self-hosted install has to know two things that are
otherwise only visible in a values file and a log: what Primer was pointed
at, and which of those are currently reachable. Both live in different
processes, so without this the answer means reading several sets of
container logs and inferring.

Restricted to administrators. A URL is not a secret, but the set of them is
a map of the deployment's inside, and an ordinary user has no use for it.

Credentials never appear here, not even redacted. A URL that carries one in
its userinfo is reported with that part removed rather than starred out: a
masked secret is still a statement about its length and shape.
