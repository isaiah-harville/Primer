"""Which driver the migration connects with.

The service hands its connection string straight to the vector integration,
which speaks psycopg 3. SQLAlchemy reads a bare `postgresql://` as psycopg 2,
so a migration run against an unmodified URL fails on a driver that is not
installed and should not be.
